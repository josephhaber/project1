This is a promotional website for a non-profit concept I developed, NBA Star Camps. 

Typically, during the summer time, a few professional basketball players and teams run their own youth camps for profit. 

NBA Star Camps would be sponsored by the league and integrated with the NBA's charitable arm, NBA Cares, so that camp proceeds (minus overhead) would go directly to the NBA's chosen charities.

The league could also incentivize players to become coaches by offering participating players spots in All-Star Weekend challenges, which current for-profit camps cannot do.
